# NuGet OIDC Publishing with GitHub Environments
#
# This workflow uses GitHub Environments to add approval gates
# and additional security controls before publishing to NuGet.org.
#
# Setup Required:
# 1. Create 'nuget-production' environment in repository settings
# 2. Add required reviewers to the environment (optional)
# 3. Configure Trusted Publishing on NuGet.org with environment name
# 4. Update the 'user' field below with your NuGet.org username
